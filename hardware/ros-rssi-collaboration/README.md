# ROS Robot-WSN Collaboration Pacakge
The nodes in this ROS package contain scripts to synchronize, share, and make use of data across a robot and wireless sensot network (WSN) nodes.
This package depends on the publicly-available ROS_network_analysis package for RSSI measurements on the robot/WSN nodes.

The network analysis package can be downloaded from:
[ros_network_analysis](https://github.com/herolab-uga/ros-network-analysis)
