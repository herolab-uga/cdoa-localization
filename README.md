# Device Localization Using Particle Filter over DOA of Wireless Signals
## Overview
This repository contains the datasets and scripts used in the experimentation for localization algorithms. Three set of experimentational content is provided in this repository: 1. Simulation, 2.Dataset1, and 3. Dataset2. Each content in enclosed in separate folder with the respective name. Simulation scripts generate data internally, however, realworld exprimentation require datasets.
### Simulation
Simulation experimentations taken place for 6 x 6 meter of bounded region where Access Point is placed on the top of the moving robot and wireless sensor nodes places at the fixed positions (corners) which are (0,0), (0,6), (6,0), and (6,6) respectively. Robot followed three different trajectoriers: Inside, Boundary and Diagonal. For each of the trajectory we predicted the position using multiple localization techniques and proposed approach as well. ![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/herolab-uga/pf-doa-localization.git/tragectory_boundary.png)
